More about me: 
 - I've been swimming since I was 6 in a swim team in Ohio! 
 Fun fact: the olympian Carson Foster (swam 400 IM in 2024 paris olympics) swam on the same team as me back when I lived in Ohio! Crazy to think I swam with an olympian once...
 
 I also like to be crafty like crochet, sew, and make jewlery

 As soon as I can, I want to adopt a cat and maybe a dog
