        <div class="subtitle">Sprint 4/5 project</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Take A Byte is a website to find new recipies of many cuisines. Users can spin a wheel to help design or ask the AI chatbot. They can also post their own recipies that aren't on the website to further expand options.</p>
            <p><strong>My specific feature</strong> I worked on the posting feature. It is accessable through the main page and users can enter data to describe the recipe they are posting</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Had difficulty figuring out the data tables. Had a lot of errors when running db.init database generating file. I fixed these by asking my groupmates for help and comparing our code in speciic files to make sure everything was up to date and working. </p>
            <p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> throughout the entire project, I worked closedly with my groupmates to run the webstie. We tired our best to make sure everyone had their features working, and keep each other in check and on track. </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Posting feature frontend:</strong> User can enter name, dish, cuisine, link, comments then post it. It requires all fields to be filled out before being able to post. After posting, a button appears which the user can click which redirects them to a new page with all posts (including the one the user just posted). On this new page, the user can also delete a post or go back home.</p>

            <p><strong>Posting feature backend:</strong> 2 users, martha and wayne, have their data stored in backend so far. Currently it is static but working on dynamic data. Their data is acessed through the buttons on the posting page, which displays their data. In backend an API sources the static data and displays it in frontend. They are also integrated into the table created from db.init.</p>

            <p><strong>Future plans with my feature:</strong> Dynamic data where the data inputed by users in the home page goes to backend and is stored there instead of locally. I also want to make it so users can only delte their own posts and not others.</p>
