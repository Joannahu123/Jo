## 🧩 SECTION 1: What Is Binary and Why Does It Matter?

### 🔢 What is Binary?
- **Binary** is a Base-2 number system made up of only `0` and `1`.
- Computers process binary to represent all types of data: **text, images, video, music, and logic.**
- One **bit** = 1 digit (0 or 1)  
  One **byte** = 8 bits → Can represent **256 values**

> 🎥 [History of Binary video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVq3F3uVqrY&ab_channel=TechnicalUpgrade)

---

### 🌍 Real-World Use Cases
- Images store pixel data using binary (e.g., RGB color codes)
- Text uses **ASCII** or **Unicode**, which map characters to binary values (e.g., `"A"` = `01000001`)
- Music and videos are stored and transmitted as binary streams

### 🧠 Binary Place Value Table

| Binary Digit       | 2⁷ | 2⁶ | 2⁵ | 2⁴ | 2³ | 2² | 2¹ | 2⁰ |
|--------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Example: `1101`    | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  |    |    |    |    |

➡ `1×8 + 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1 = 13`

Fill out the rest of the table and calculate what value is in binary: (final value should be 25)
</div>

## 🔁 SECTION 2: Converting Between Binary & Decimal

### 🔄 Decimal to Binary (Divide by 2 Method)

**Steps:**
1. Divide the number by 2  
2. Record the remainder  
3. Repeat until the quotient is 0  
4. Read the remainders *bottom to top*

**Example: Convert 25 to Binary**
- 25 ÷ 2 = 12 R1  
- 12 ÷ 2 = 6 R0  
- 6 ÷ 2 = 3 R0  
- 3 ÷ 2 = 1 R1  
- 1 ÷ 2 = 0 R1  
➡ Binary: `11001`

### 🔁 Binary to Decimal

**Example:**
`1101` = 1×8 + 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1 = **13**

## 🔎 SECTION 3: Binary Search vs Linear Search

### 📘 What is Binary Search?

<div class="highlight-box">
<b>Binary Search</b> is a powerful algorithm used to quickly find an element in a <b>sorted</b> list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
</div>

Binary search is **much faster** than linear search for large datasets. It’s often referred to as a **"divide and conquer"** algorithm.

**Steps:**
1. Check the **middle element**  
2. If it’s the target, return it  
3. If not, search the **left or right half**  
4. Repeat until found or empty

---

## ⚠️ Limitations of Binary Search

- 🚫 List must be **sorted**
- 😵 Not useful for **very small datasets**
- 🧩 A bit more complex to code

---

### 🔁 Comparison with Linear Search

| Feature            | **Binary Search**                   | **Linear Search**                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Requires sorted?   | ✅ Yes                                | ❌ No                               |
| Speed (steps)      | Fast – **log₂(n)** steps             | Slow – **up to n** steps           |
| Example (100 items)| ~7 steps                             | Up to 100 steps                    |
| Best for...        | Large, sorted data sets              | Small or unsorted lists            |

## 📚 Real-Life Analogy

<div class="warning-box">
📘 Imagine you're looking up the word <b>"binary"</b> in a dictionary:

<ul>
  <li>Instead of flipping one page at a time, you open the dictionary in the <b>middle</b>.</li>
  <li>If the page shows words starting with "M", you go left.</li>
  <li>If it shows "Z", you still go left.</li>
  <li>Eventually, you land on "binary" in just a few steps — even in a thick dictionary!</li>
</ul>
</div>

### 🌍 Real-World Applications

- Search engines use it in **indexing**
- Databases (e.g., search by name or ID)
- Games (search sorted object arrays)
- Phonebook/contact search

---

### ⚖️ Pros & Cons

**Binary Search**
- ✅ Fast for large datasets  
- ✅ Scalable  
- ❌ Needs sorted data  
- ❌ More complex

**Linear Search**
- ✅ Simple to implement  
- ✅ Works on anything  
- ❌ Very slow for large lists

<div class="hack-box">
🍿 <b>Popcorn Hack #3: Half & Half!</b><br>

## 🐍 Binary Search in Python

```python
# Define the binary search function
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Set the left and right bounds of the list
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    # Continue the loop while the bounds have not crossed
    while left <= right:
        # Find the middle index
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        print(f"Checking index {mid}: {arr[mid]}")  # Debug print

        # If the middle value is the target, return the index
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # If the target is greater, search the right half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        # If the target is smaller, search the left half
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1  # If not found, return -1

# Example list
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]

# Search for the number 7 in the list
print(binary_search(numbers, 7))  # Output: 3
```

## 🌐 Binary Search in JavaScript

```javascript
// Define the binary search function
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    // Set the left and right bounds of the list
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    // Loop while the bounds haven't crossed
    while (left <= right) {
        // Find the middle index
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        console.log("Checking index:", mid, arr[mid]); // Debug print

        // If the middle value is the target, return the index
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        // If the target is greater, search the right half
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        // If the target is smaller, search the left half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    // If the target is not found, return -1
    return -1;
}

// Example list
let numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13];

// Search for the number 7 in the list
console.log(binarySearch(numbers, 7)); // Output: 3
```
