# 🚀 From Curiosity to Confidence: My APCSP Journey  
### *By Joanna Hu*

## 🌱 Starting Point: Trimester 1 – Foundations  
- Began with **no coding experience**
- Built my **first personal website** using HTML/CSS and GitHub Pages  
  - Learned structure, design, and publishing
- Discovered how computer science connects to **engineering creativity**

## 💻 Trimester 2 – Coding & Collaboration  
- Focused on **core programming skills**  
  - Learned and studied **JavaScript Essentials** 
- Created **frontend/backend features** with real user input and logic
- Used **Git**, GitHub, and version control for team projects
- Worked in a **HyFlex collaborative environment**:
  - Practiced **Agile development**
  - Helped with debugging, and deployment  
- Gained confidence solving problems in **team-based settings**, similar to real-world engineering teams

## 📊 Trimester 3 – Exploring Data Science  
- Challenged myself with **Data Analysis using Python**
    - used databases, creation and backup of
- Created an **engineering-focused posting feature**
  - Learned how data flows between frontend and backend
- Built a deeper understanding of **smart systems and embedded logic** through my cookbook project, key in **mechanical engineering**

## 🛠️ Skills Earned (Microcredentials & NFTs)
**Certificates (Foundational Skills):**
- GitHub Pages
- JavaScript Essentials
- Data Analysis with Python and javascript
- Deployment Concepts

**NFTs (Unique Achievements):**
- Personalized Website NFT
- Engineering Database Project NFT (custom full-stack application)

## 🔗 Why It Matters for Mechanical Engineering  
- Mechanical engineers need **digital fluency**:
  - Embedded systems, simulation tools, smart tech
- APCSP taught me to:
  - **Think in systems**
  - **Communicate in code**
  - **Collaborate in agile teams**
- Built mindset of **persistence, experimentation, and curiosity**

## 📌 Final Thoughts  
- APCSP helped me **grow technically and personally**
- Learned to **embrace complexity**, ask questions, and lead my learning
- The **Open Coding Society** model reflects my journey:
  - **Microcredentials** for foundations
  - **NFTs** for unique, creative contributions
- This course helped me become a **more confident, capable future engineer**
