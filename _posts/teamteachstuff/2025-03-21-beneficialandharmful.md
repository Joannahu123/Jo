# Beneficial and Harmful Effects  

## Popcorn Hack 1  
- A **beneficial effect** is when technology serves a helpful purpose to people and the overall development of society.  
- A **harmful effect** is when technology has a negative impact or puts people in difficult positions.  

## Popcorn Hack 2  
The most beneficial out of these to me is **access to education** because it helps pass knowledge and development onto the next generation, so they can continue improving society and technology.  

## Popcorn Hack 3  
For **gene editing**, I think it’s more harmful than good for now, mostly because editing physical features can be really toxic and worsen people’s perception of beauty. It is also most likely very expensive, making it accessible only to the wealthy, which can cause polarization in society between the rich and poor.  

## Homework Hack: Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
AI has made life a lot easier by handling boring, repetitive tasks and helping people make better decisions with data. It’s super useful in healthcare, where it can detect diseases early and suggest treatments. But there are some drawbacks: for example, some jobs might disappear because machines can do the work instead. At the same time, AI is creating new kinds of jobs, so people just have to learn different skills. Overall, if we use it right, AI can do a lot of good and make things more efficient.
