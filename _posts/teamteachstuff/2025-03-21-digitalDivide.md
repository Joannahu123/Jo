- **B:** Neighborhoods receive data-capped internet plans, making streaming and frequent updates expensive.  
- **B:** Address core issues of the digital divide.  

## Homework Hack  
In my community, I’ve seen a digital divide in social class where people who are lower class struggle to afford reliable internet and updated devices, making education and keeping up with other students more difficult.  

Especially since education at Del Norte is heavily reliant on technology—some classes even using only computers like computer science—internet access and updated devices are really important for students to succeed in high school.  

Those who can’t afford up-to-date technology have to put in more effort to make up for the digital divide gap while still receiving the same grade, which can be unfair for them as it isn’t necessarily under their control.  

To fix this, I can help by spreading awareness by sharing this paragraph with my classmates and teachers so they are aware of the digital divide at Del Norte.  

I can also bring this topic up in conversations with my friends and family, which can spark more thorough discussions and encourage them to talk about the digital divide with their own friends.
