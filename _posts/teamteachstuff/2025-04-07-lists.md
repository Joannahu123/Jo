    <h2>Popcorn Hack 1: What are some possible benefits of using lists? What are some real world examples of lists being used in code?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It can store a lot of data in one place thatâ€™s easy to find</li>
        <li>Access them individually</li>
        <li>Sort and organize the data for easier use</li>
    </ul>

items.append("sharpener")
print(items[2])
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Output: eraser</p>

    <h2>Popcorn Hack 3: What are some real world examples of filtering algorithms?</h2>
